Polls are a brilliant way to engage visitors. Forminator gives real-time feedback with live stats displayed in beautiful pie charts and graphs.

Who hasn't been roped into taking “IQ tests” and “figure out which Star Wars character you are” quizzes on Facebook? Now you can run all that traffic to your site. Create both knowledge and no wrong answer quizzes with Forminator.

### Collect Leads With Your Quizzes

Looking to use your quizzes for more than just entertainment and a way to engage your audience? Forminator also allows you to collect participants' details (e.g., name, email, etc.) by integrating a lead generation form in your quiz.

### Gutenberg Block

Forminator’s got you, whether you’re a classic editor or Gutenberg early adapter. Say goodbye to shortcodes and quickly add forms to posts with the Forminator block for Gutenberg.

### Email Routing and Pre-Populate

Make your site more efficient from visitor input to email response times. Use query strings to pre-fill your visitor information and deliver forms direct to specific teams with email routing, auto-response and conditions.

### User Front End Post Submissions
Want to let your visitors share a post submission without needing access to the WordPress dashboard? With Forminator visitors can submit post ideas from the front end of your site so you can easily curate and publish their thoughts. Assign post to a default author, save to draft, publish immediately, etc.

### Google reCAPTCHA

You don’t want your inbox flooded with a bunch of form spam. Google ReCAPTCHA is free with Forminator. Now you can stop the crazy bots without making it hard on your visitors. No more hard to read random phrases.

### Antispam Features

Protect your forms with built-in antispam tools like reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, and Cloudflare Turnstile. You can also allow or block specific email addresses, domains, or TLDs using customizable email filters.

### Cloud and Preset Templates

Jumpstart form creation with Preset Templates, or save time by reusing your own custom forms across sites using Cloud Templates synced through the HUB.

### Collect, Track and GDPR Ready

Forminator stores and organizes submissions so you can sort, analyze and manage responses – of course, all while making it super easy to comply with the GDPR and other legal privacy policies.

### Import Your Existing Contact Form 7 Data

Looking to move existing forms over from CF7? Forminator’s Import Wizard allows you to migrate all, or selected forms in a matter of clicks. You can also transfer data from a range of Contact Form 7 add-ons and settings.

### Custom Login and Registration Forms

Create and embed custom login and registration forms for your sites (or multisites!). Take L&R forms to the next level: choose from a range of form fields, and customize settings, style, and behavior.

### Multi-file Upload Field

Along with enabling single file uploads, Forminator takes things up a notch by allowing users to upload multiple files. You can also choose to set specific file types, limit the number of files that can be uploaded, as well as the individual file size. The upload field’s drag and drop interface also makes it a breeze for users to upload files.

### Group And Repeat Form Fields

The Field Group feature allows you to group any number of fields together in one form. You can also enable users to add as many additional field groups as needed when filling out your form. Great for repeatable data entry such as employment history, event attendees, lists, etc.

### Advanced Date Field Restrictions 

Perfect for appointment and hotel bookings - Forminator’s Date Picker Limits feature allows you to restrict the available dates shown on your date field calendar. For example, you might show future dates only, a selected number of dates from today, dates between a specific date range, specific days of the week, and more! 

### Add An E-Signature Form Field (Pro Only)*

Have an online application that requires a signature, or a contract you need your customers to sign? Forminator’s E-signature feature allows visitors to use their mouse, trackpad, or finger (on touch devices) to leave a signature upon submitting the form. Just insert the “E-Signature” field and voila! 

### Receive Subscriptions and Recurring Payments on Stripe (Pro Only)*

Create fully-customized subscription forms with Forminator Pro’s Stripe Subscription add-on. Allow your customers to choose plans/pricing, billing cycle, custom upsells, a free trial option, and of course, make secure card payments. Forminator also saves you time by instantly and automatically syncing all subscription form data straight to your Stripe account.

***Note:** These features are only available with [Forminator Pro](https://wpmudev.com/project/forminator-pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=forminator-readme&utm_content=forminator_pro).
